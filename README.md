# Arduino SFM3003 I2C Library

 An SFM3003 library compiled for the Arduino Core platform

 This is a library for the SFM3003 I2C mass-flow sensor. It is compatible with the Arduino Core platform, and contains examples as well as the Sensirion Core library (so that you do not need another library to use the SFM3003).
